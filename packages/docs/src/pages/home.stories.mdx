### Welcome! Many design systems have been built... and this is one of them.

ðŸ‘ˆ Please navigate using the folder structure on the left hand side to check our patterns for **colors, fonts, spaces** and elements such as **buttons** and **other inputs**. 

ðŸš¨ Notice that tokens and other design aspects are framework-agnostic, but this project is using react to implement the UI.
